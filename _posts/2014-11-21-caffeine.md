Caffeine 9 to 5 is a commentary on the often cyclical and confusing nature of
work. Starting from the bottom going clockwise, we begin the day with
sentiments of play, ease, and openness. The mind appears to be free and perfect,
but as the day draws to a close, the scene is violently interrupted by a
mishmash of angularity, darkness, noise, and strange creatures. Following this
disturbance, the subject awakens to a contorted, rectangular version of himself.
He then sips on a beverage and embarks again on his daily adventure.

My hopes with this drawing are to illustrate the cyclical dynamics of work and
to encourage the viewer to imagine new dimensions outside the normal confines of
assumed reality.
